* Task_2: Fundamentals of GO Tasks
  - **Description**: This task focuses on the fundamentals of Go programming language. It includes exercises to understand basic Go syntax, data types, loops, functions, and error handling. It serves as an introduction to the Go language, helping to build a strong foundation.
  - [Instruction Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D_a537bwoDh63MUNjzSq9H0kNT7zBXYtZM2q30wPTBQ/edit?usp=sharing)

* Task_3: Console Based Library Management System
  - **Description**: This task involves building a console-based application to manage a library system. The focus is on implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and understanding how to structure a simple project in Go.
  - [Instruction Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qIpGCpiOzalySPoUoyOQR-sDgUnlfgY-cB68DqXJtPU/edit)

* Task_4: Task Management REST API
  - **Description**: This task requires creating a RESTful API for a task management system. It introduces RESTful API design principles and practices, along with handling HTTP requests, responses, and status codes in Go.
  - [Instruction Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YK8F4v77b7nUK8lKbEYNSbSJZLRjKG0IbeaPamw3__A/edit?usp=sharing)

* Task_5: Task Management REST API With Authentication
  - **Description**: Building upon the previous task, this task introduces user authentication into the Task Management REST API. The goal is to learn how to implement secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and manage user sessions.
  - [Instruction Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R_-nBiuYku5vHIEe88dfV40j-U5JqhaptgnozpdI0IM/edit?usp=sharing)

* Task_6: Task Management REST API With MongoDB
  - **Description**: This task further extends the Task Management REST API by integrating MongoDB as the database. The API is now capable of performing CRUD operations on a MongoDB database, making it more robust and scalable.
  - [Instruction Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eB8dC2Q7Lbf3XfFButwz1FpZqng6h1CA3mWDbXTcUG0/edit?usp=sharing)

* Task_7: Applying Clean Architecture Task Management REST API
  - **Description**: This task refactors the existing Task Management REST API to follow clean architecture principles. The goal is to understand how to structure a scalable and maintainable codebase by separating concerns into different layers (e.g., domain, use cases, interfaces).
  - [Instruction Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xNlwC6dfAoJeO0tUfJm5_sSKaxATI9glNN2EHtFyews/edit?usp=sharing)

* Task_8: Testing Task Management REST API
  - **Description**: The final task involves adding comprehensive testing to the Task Management REST API. This includes writing unit tests using the Testify framework and setting up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to ensure the reliability of the codebase.
